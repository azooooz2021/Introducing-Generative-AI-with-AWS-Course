# 🌳 Decision Tree for Customer Churn Prediction

## 📊 Project Overview

Build a decision tree model to predict customer churn for a telecom company. As a data analyst, help the marketing department identify which customers are most likely to leave next month.

## 💼 Business Context

Customer churn prediction helps companies:
- 🎯 Identify at-risk customers before they churn
- 🛡️ Implement targeted retention strategies
- 💰 Reduce customer acquisition costs

## 📋 Dataset Description

Synthetic dataset with customer information:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `CustomerID` | 🆔 Unique customer identifier |
| `Age` | 👤 Customer age |
| `MonthlyCharge` | 💳 Monthly bill amount |
| `CustomerServiceCalls` | 📞 Number of customer service contacts |
| `Churn` | 🎯 Target variable (Yes/No) |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📦 Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

### ▶️ Running the Analysis
1. 📓 Open `Decision-Tree.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
2. ⚡ Run all cells sequentially

## 🔬 Methodology

1. **📊 Data Exploration** - Load and explore the dataset
2. **📈 EDA** - Visualize churn patterns and relationships
3. **🔧 Preprocessing** - Prepare data for modeling
4. **🌳 Model Building** - Build and train decision tree classifier
5. **📏 Evaluation** - Assess performance and feature importance
6. **💡 Business Insights** - Translate results into recommendations

## 📊 Key Metrics

- **🎯 Accuracy**: Overall prediction correctness
- **🔍 Precision**: Proportion of predicted churners who actually churned
- **📢 Recall**: Proportion of actual churners correctly identified
- **⚖️ F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

- 🔍 Identify key factors contributing to customer churn
- 📈 Predict which customers are likely to churn
