# Supervised Learning - Building Energy Efficiency Prediction

## Overview
This project contains supervised learning code to predict the energy efficiency of buildings. The code is part of the Udacity course curriculum.

## Part 1: Predicting Building Energy Efficiency (Supervised Learning)

### Scenario
You are working for an architecture firm, and your task is to build a model that predicts the energy efficiency rating of buildings based on features like:
- Wall area
- Roof area
- Overall height
- And other building characteristics

### Project Structure
- `Supervised-Learning.ipynb` - Main Jupyter notebook containing the supervised learning implementation
- `.ipynb_checkpoints/` - Jupyter notebook checkpoints

### Purpose
The supervised learning code in this project is designed to:
- Analyze building characteristics and their impact on energy efficiency
- Build predictive models for energy efficiency ratings
- Apply machine learning techniques to real-world architectural problems

### Course Information
This code is from the Udacity course "Introducing Generative AI with AWS" and serves as a practical application of supervised learning concepts in the context of building energy efficiency prediction.

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed
2. The Jupyter environment is located at `/udacity-course/jupyter-env`
3. Open `Supervised-Learning.ipynb` to explore the implementation

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning libraries for supervised learning
